                    One of my favourite hobbies is to play guitar.The guitar is a string instrument which is
                    played by plucking the strings. The main parts of a guitar are the body, the fretboard, the
                    headstock and
                    the strings. ... Different finger positions on the fretboard make different notes.
                    Guitar-like plucked string instruments have been used for many years.Another essential aspect of the
                    guitar
                    is the tuning, which can be observed in the category of three basic types, namely standard tuning,
                    alternative tuning, and scordatura tuning. In this context, essays can also be provided regarding
                    the
                    tunings. A standard tuning of the guitar focuses on an octave range of EADGBE.

                    game loved

                    My favourite poet is Rabindranath Tagore.One of his poems are as follows :-
                    <blockquote>
                        Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;
                        Where knowledge is free;
                        Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
                        Where words come out from the depth of truth;
                        Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;
                        Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
                        Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action
                        Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.
